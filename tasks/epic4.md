# EPIC 4: Backend Development

## Overview
This EPIC covers the development of the Python backend server, API endpoints, and basic system functionality. The implementation will support both local execution and cloud deployment on Google Cloud Run, with a focus on maintaining local development capabilities while enabling cloud deployment.

## User Stories

### US 4.1: Core Backend Server Setup
As a developer, I want to set up a Python backend server that can run both locally and in Google Cloud Run.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create Flask application with environment-aware configuration
- [ ] Implement server startup logic that works in both local and cloud environments
- [ ] Set up basic health check endpoint
- [ ] Configure CORS for both local and cloud environments
- [ ] Document server setup and configuration

### US 4.2: API Endpoints Implementation
As a developer, I want to implement API endpoints that work consistently in both local and cloud environments.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement authentication endpoint with hardcoded credentials
- [ ] Create SOAP note generation endpoint with environment-aware configuration
- [ ] Implement template management endpoints
- [ ] Create phrase bank management endpoints
- [ ] Add request validation for all endpoints
- [ ] Document API endpoints and their usage

### US 4.3: Environment-Aware Configuration
As a developer, I want to manage configuration that works in both local and cloud environments.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create configuration management system
- [ ] Implement local configuration using .env files
- [ ] Set up cloud configuration using environment variables
- [ ] Add configuration validation
- [ ] Document configuration management

### US 4.4: Error Handling and Logging
As a developer, I want to implement error handling and logging that works in both environments.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Implement basic error handling middleware
- [ ] Set up local file logging
- [ ] Configure cloud logging integration
- [ ] Create error response formatting
- [ ] Document error handling and logging

### US 4.5: Local Testing Environment
As a developer, I want to maintain a fully functional local testing environment.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create test configuration for local environment
- [ ] Implement mock services for local testing
- [ ] Set up test utilities and helpers
- [ ] Create test data fixtures
- [ ] Document local testing procedures

### US 4.6: Cloud Run Preparation
As a developer, I want to prepare the backend for Google Cloud Run deployment.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create Dockerfile for containerization
- [ ] Configure container health checks
- [ ] Set up container environment variables
- [ ] Test container locally
- [ ] Document container configuration

## Dependencies
