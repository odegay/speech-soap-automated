# EPIC 1: Core Application Setup

## Overview
This EPIC covers the initial setup and configuration of the project infrastructure and basic application structure.

## User Stories

### 1. Project Repository Setup
**As a** developer  
**I want to** have a properly structured project repository  
**So that** I can start development work efficiently

**Tasks:**
- [x] Initialize Git repository
- [x] Create basic directory structure
- [x] Set up .gitignore file
- [x] Create initial README.md
- [x] Set up branch protection rules

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Repository is accessible to the team
- Directory structure follows best practices
- .gitignore includes all necessary patterns
- README.md contains basic project information
- Branch protection rules are configured

### 2. Development Environment Configuration
**As a** developer  
**I want to** have a consistent development environment  
**So that** I can work efficiently and avoid environment-related issues

**Tasks:**
- [x] Create requirements.txt for Python dependencies
- [x] Set up virtual environment configuration
- [x] Create environment setup script
- [x] Document environment setup process
- [x] Create development guidelines

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All team members can set up the environment using the script
- Dependencies are properly versioned
- Setup process is documented
- Development guidelines are clear and comprehensive

### 3. Google Cloud Build Setup
**As a** developer  
**I want to** have a configured Google Cloud Build
**So that** The application can be deployed to Google Cloud after the commit to the main branch

**Tasks:**
- [x] Create cloudbuild.yaml file

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- cloudbuild.yaml file is created and accessible

### 4. Web Application Structure
**As a** developer  
**I want to** have a basic web application structure  
**So that** I can start implementing features

**Tasks:**
- [x] Choose and set up frontend framework
- [x] Create basic frontend structure
- [x] Set up build configuration
- [x] Create basic component structure
- [x] Set up routing

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Application runs locally
- Build process works
- Basic routing is functional
- Component structure is clear
- Framework is properly configured

### 5. OpenAI API Integration
**As a** developer  
**I want to** have OpenAI API integration set up  
**So that** I can use LLM capabilities in the application

**Tasks:**
- [x] OpenAI API credentials should be stored in a plain format in the .env file (added to .gitignore)
- [x] Create API client configuration
- [x] Implement basic API wrapper
- [x] Add error handling
- [x] Create usage documentation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Placeholder for the OpenAI API credentials in the .env file (added to .gitignore)
- Basic API calls work
- Error handling is in place
- Usage is documented
- Rate limiting is considered

### 6. Modular Architecture Implementation
**As a** developer  
**I want to** have a modular architecture  
**So that** the application is maintainable and extensible

**Tasks:**
- [x] Define component boundaries
- [x] Set up configurable interfaces
- [x] Create extensible data structures
- [x] Document extension points
- [x] Create architecture documentation

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Component boundaries are clearly defined
- Interfaces are properly documented
- Data structures are extensible
- Extension points are identified
- Architecture is documented

### 7. Local Development Environment
**As a** developer  
**I want to** have a complete local development environment  
**So that** I can develop and test without cloud dependencies

**Tasks:**
- [x] Create local configuration files
- [x] Set up local API endpoints
- [x] Configure local LLM integration
- [x] Create mock services
- [x] Document local setup process

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Application runs completely locally
- All services are accessible
- Mock services work as expected
- Setup process is documented
- Local development is fully functional

## Dependencies
- None

## Technical Notes
- Use Python 3.x for backend
- Use simplest possible frontend framework for PoC
- Implement proper error handling from the start
- Document all configuration processes
- Consider future extensibility in all decisions

## Definition of Done
- All acceptance criteria are met
- Code is properly documented
- Setup processes are documented
- Local development environment is fully functional
- Team can start development work
