# Speech Therapy SOAP Notes Automation - MVP Implementation Plan

## EPIC 1: Core Application Setup
- [ ] Set up project repository and basic structure
- [ ] Configure development environment
- [ ] Set up Google Cloud project
- [ ] Initialize basic web application structure (using simplest framework for PoC)
- [ ] Set up OpenAI API integration
- [ ] Implement modular architecture for future extensibility:
  - [ ] Define clear component boundaries
  - [ ] Set up configurable interfaces
  - [ ] Create extensible data structures
  - [ ] Document extension points

## EPIC 2: User Interface Development
- [ ] Create basic login page (hardcoded credentials)
- [ ] Design and implement main dashboard
- [ ] Create SOAP note entry form with:
  - [ ] Patient disposition checklist
  - [ ] Activities/materials selection
  - [ ] Setting/context dropdown
  - [ ] Interaction style selection
  - [ ] Language modality selection
  - [ ] Engagement level dropdown
  - [ ] Cooperation level dropdown
  - [ ] Primary focus dropdown
  - [ ] Communication examples text area with the Phrase Bank System integration
  - [ ] Difficulties/errors text area with the Phrase Bank System integration
  - [ ] Unique observations text area with the Phrase Bank System integration
- [ ] Implement phrase bank/template system with type-search functionality
- [ ] Add edit functionality for LLM-generated text with phrase bank integration
- [ ] Implement "Save as Text" functionality

## EPIC 3: LLM Integration
- [ ] Set up OpenAI API connection
- [ ] Design prompt engineering system
- [ ] Implement text generation logic
- [ ] Create text formatting and structure templates
- [ ] Add basic error handling with user notifications
- [ ] Implement text editing capabilities with phrase bank integration

## EPIC 4: Backend Development
- [ ] Set up Python backend server
- [ ] Create API endpoints for:
  - [ ] Basic authentication (hardcoded credentials)
  - [ ] SOAP note generation
  - [ ] Template management
  - [ ] Phrase bank management
- [ ] Implement basic data validation
- [ ] Set up basic error handling
- [ ] Create simple logging system

## EPIC 5: Deployment
- [ ] Configure Google Cloud environment
- [ ] Set up basic deployment pipeline
- [ ] Deploy application
- [ ] Configure basic logging
- [ ] Document deployment process

## Resolved Questions
1. Frontend Framework: Using simplest framework suitable for PoC/MVP
2. Error Recovery: Basic API error handling with user notifications
3. User Load: Single user, monthly usage (performance not a concern)
4. Caching: No caching required
5. Login System: Hardcoded credentials in backend code
6. Data Export: Simple "Save as Text" functionality
7. Phrase Bank: Type-search functionality required
8. Input Validation: Placeholders only, no validation rules
9. Text Editing: Integration with phrase bank only
10. Backup: No backup mechanisms required
11. Future Extensibility: Modular design with clear interfaces and configurable components
